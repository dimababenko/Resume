                        the platform. I did even system release uploads to the production. A few times rolled back DB backup after critical bugs.

                    <p>&emsp;Once I spent 1 week restoring generated records a in few important tables, storing data about employees
                        skills levels. That happened because I missed wrong condition in SQL stored procedure during code review to my
                        teammate. Designed logic for creating tables with generated names in a real time. This
                        caused delays on the UI and currently I understand how wrong that practice was :)
