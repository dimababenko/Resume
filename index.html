                        As a part of the internal team, I rapidly became a key person of this small team (4-5 people). In scope of

                        counteragents, developing new functionalities and customizations for the platform. Sometimes I had to do even system release
                        uploads to the production. Few times rolled back DB backup after critical bugs.
                    </p>
                    <p>&emsp;Once I spent 1 week restoring generated records a in few important tables, storing data about employees
                        skills levels. That happened because I missed wrong condition in SQL stored procedure during code review to my
                        teammate. Developed logic, which had logic for creating tables with generated names in a real time. This
                        caused delays on the UI and currently I understand how wrong that practice was :)
